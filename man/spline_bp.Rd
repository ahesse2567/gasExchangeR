\arguments{
\item{.data}{Gas exchange data.}

\item{.x}{The x-axis variable.}

\item{.y}{the y-axis variable.}

\item{bp}{Is this algorithm being used to find vt1 or vt2?}

\item{degree}{The degree of polynomial spline to use. Default is 1 to mimic other algorithms.}

\item{vo2}{The name of the vo2 column in \code{.data}}

\item{vco2}{The name of the vco2 column in \code{.data}}

\item{ve}{The name of the ve column in \code{.data}}

\item{time}{The name of the time column in \code{.data}}

\item{front_trim_vt1}{How much data (in seconds) to remove from the beginning of the test prior to fitting any regressions. The original V-slope paper suggests 1 minute.}

\item{front_trim_vt2}{How much data (in seconds) to remove from the beginning of the test prior to fitting any regressions. The original V-slope paper suggests 1 minute.}

\item{alpha_linearity}{Significance value to determine if a piecewise model explains significantly reduces the residual sums of squares more than a simpler model.}

\item{pos_change}{Do you expect the change in slope to be positive (default) or negative? If a two-line regression explains significantly reduces the sum square error but the change in slope does not match the expected underlying physiology, the breakpoint will be classified as indeterminate.}

\item{...}{Dot dot dot mostly allows this function to work properly if breakpoint() passes arguments that is not strictly needed by this function.}

\value{
A list including slice of the original data frame at the threshold index with new columns `algorithm`, `determinant_bp`, `pct_slope_change`, `f_stat`, and `p_val_f.` The list also includes the fitted values, the left and right sides of the piecewise regression, and a simiple linear regression.
}
\description{
This function is similar to other piecewise regression formulas in that it iteratively moves the breakpoint along all n-2 inner data points. We recommend using this function for relationships such as VCO2 vs. VO2 (V-slope), VE vs. VCO2 (respiratory compensation point), and excess CO2, provided that the first ~1 minute of data is removed from excess CO2 prior to fitting the curve.
