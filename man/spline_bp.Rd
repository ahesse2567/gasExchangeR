spline_bp(
  .data,
  .x,
  .y,
  degree = 1,
  vo2 = "vo2",
  vco2 = "vco2",
  ve = "ve",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Gas exchange data.}

\item{.x}{The x-axis variable.}

\item{.y}{the y-axis variable.}

\item{degree}{The degree of polynomial spline to use. Default is 1 to mimic other algorithms.}

\item{vo2}{The name of the vo2 column in \code{.data}}

\item{vco2}{The name of the vco2 column in \code{.data}}

\item{ve}{The name of the ve column in \code{.data}}

\item{time}{The name of the time column in \code{.data}}

\item{alpha_linearity}{Significance value to determine if a piecewise model explains significantly reduces the residual sums of squares more than a simpler model.}

\item{bp}{Is this algorithm being used to find vt1 or vt2?}

\item{pos_change}{Do you expect the change in slope to be positive (default) or negative? If a two-line regression explains significantly reduces the sum square error but the change in slope does not match the expected underlying physiology, the breakpoint will be classified as indeterminate.}
