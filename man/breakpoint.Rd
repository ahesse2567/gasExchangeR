\description{
Find breakpoints in gas exchange data
}
\details{
There are multiple ways to find a breakpoint. The first is by specifying a commonly used \code{method} and the appropriate \code{split} and \code{.x}, and \code{y}, variables will be selected for you. For example, entering 'v-slope' for \code{method} will pre-select 'v-slope' for \code{split}, 'vo2' for .x, and 'vco2' for .y. If you enter a specific \code{method}, you can override the default \code{split}, \code{.x}, and \code{.y}.

Since there aren't common names for every way to find a breakpoint, you can also leave \code{method} as \code{NULL} and specify the \code{split}, \code{.x}, and \code{.y}.
