#' Finding a breakpoint using Cheng's Dmax algorithm
#'
#' As decribed by Cheng (1992) with modifications for brevity, a third order curvilinear regressions is first calculated. Pilot work demonstrated that a third order regression produced higher correlations coefficients than first and second order regressions, with the use of greater than a third order regression not significantly increasing the correlation coefficient. Next, a straight line formed by the two end points in each curve was drawn. Then a formula for computing the distance from point to line was used to calculate the distance from each point on the curve to the straight line. The point yielding the maximal distance (Dmax) derived from the computation was taken as the threshold.

#' @param .data Gas exchange data.
#' @param .x The x-axis variable.
#' @param .y the y-axis variable.
#' @param bp Is this algorithm being used to find vt1 or vt2?
#' @param ... Dot dot dot mostly allows this function to work properly if breakpoint() passes arguments that is not strictly needed by this function.
#' @param vo2 The name of the vo2 column in \code{.data}
#' @param vco2 The name of the vco2 column in \code{.data}
#' @param ve The name of the ve column in \code{.data}
#' @param time The name of the time column in \code{.data}
#' @param alpha_linearity Significance value to determine if a piecewise model explains significantly reduces the residual sums of squares more than a simpler model.
#' @param ordering Prior to fitting any functions, should the data be reordered by the x-axis variable or by time? Default is to use the current x-axis variable and use the time variable to break any ties.
#' @param pos_change Do you expect the change in slope to be positive (default) or negative? If a two-line regression explains significantly reduces the sum square error but the change in slope does not match the expected underlying physiology, the breakpoint will be classified as indeterminate.
#' @param pos_slope_after_bp Should the slope after the breakpoint be positive? Default is `TRUE`. This catches cases when the percent change in slope is positive, but the second slope is still negative. Change to `FALSE` when PetCO2 is the y-axis variable.
#'
#' @return A list including slice of the original data frame at the threshold index with new columns `algorithm`, `determinant_bp`, `pct_slope_change`, `f_stat`, and `p_val_f.` The list also includes the fitted values, the left and right sides of the piecewise regression, and a simple linear regression.
