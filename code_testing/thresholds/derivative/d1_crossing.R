# for derivative methods, do users need to choose how they want the function
# created, and then what derivative method to use? e.g. they say they want
# to use a polynomial regression, regression splines, or smoothing splines.
# then, they say if they want to use 2nd derivative maxima, 1st derivative crossing
# or 2nd derivative inflection

# d1 crossing is most similar to Wis√©n and Wohlfart (2004)
# this is a VT1 method ONLY
