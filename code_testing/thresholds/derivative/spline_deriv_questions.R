# Questions for Dr. Zieffler
# "suboptimal" fitting?
# basically, am I asking for the most conservative way to fit these models?

# Are these previous methods using polynomial splines and just calling
# them "smoothing" splines because splines "smooth" the data?

# Demonstrate likelihood ratio test, cross-validated MSE, and AICc?


# What is the best way to find the 2nd derivative of a b-spline or natural
# spline function?

############################# Other Question #################################
# Is it possible to fit a smoothing spline of an order higher than 3rd?



# store something in an object, only print part of it?



# need a print() method for the output of breakpoint()
# plot() method, summary() method, too
