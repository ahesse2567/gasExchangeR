# gasExchangeR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gasExchangeR is to help exercise physiologist more easily analyze gas exchange data and to provide more directly control when doing so. The overview of the process of analyzing gas exchange data involves importing the data, identifying and removing outliers, interpolating if desired, and finally averaging the data. Afterwards then one can determine ventilatory thresholds, VO2max, and other important values.

## Early acknowledgemets

This package borrows heavily from the work by Felipe Mattioni Maturana (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4221-6104). Specifically, his work on the [whippr](https://github.com/fmmattioni/whippr) and [lacater](https://fmmattioni.github.io/lactater/) packages. [gasExchangeR](https://github.com/ahesse2567/gasExchangeR) focuses more on graded exercise testing than VO2 kinetics; it also emphasizes ventilatory breakpoint methods.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gasExchangeR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ahesse2567/gasExchangeR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(gasExchangeR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
